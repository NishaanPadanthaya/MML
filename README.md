The clinical term extraction is part of our course project for MML. It focuses on Named-Entity-Recognition(NER) which involves building a Logistic regression model 
to classify the medical speciality based on the transcriptions, processing text using NLP,using PCA for dimensionality reduction,
using a pretrained model called scispacy for extracting clinical terms from our dataset which consists of medical text.
